Documentation URL: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs

Comments:
The Google Cloud Translate API documentation is comprehensive and clearly segmented.

It provides sample code snippets for multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

Authentication is required using an API key, which must be securely stored.

Response structure is clean and JSON-based, making it easy to parse and display results in the web app.
